# Changelog

All notable changes to hermes-dreaming. Dates are the release day; the version
is the one in `plugin.json`.

## 2.2.0 — 2026-10-08

An external review of 2.1.1 (another agent read the code against the Hermes
0.21.5 source, ran the suite and a pass on synthetic Russian data, and had every
finding re-checked by separate sceptics) produced 17 fixes. All of them are in,
plus three ideas taken from the same review. Backwards compatible: no config key
changed meaning, and old state files are still read.

### Fixed — the memory model

- **The unit of memory is the §-entry, not the paragraph.** The pass used to
  split memory files on blank lines as well, so an anchor could come from the
  middle of a multi-paragraph entry — and `memory replace` rewrites the whole
  entry it finds. On a live `MEMORY.md` one "correct" replace cut the file from
  6 261 to 996 characters. Parsing now mirrors the core exactly (`\n§\n`,
  `utf-8-sig`), with one tolerance: a delimiter at the very start of a file.
- **Anchors are raw.** They used to be handed over with collapsed whitespace
  while the core matches `old_text` as a literal substring: 5 of 56 anchors on a
  live file matched nothing, and every miss counts toward the core's per-turn
  failure guard. An anchor is now a verbatim single line, unique among entries.
- **`nearest_entry` says what is at stake:** `full_entry` (the exact text about
  to be overwritten, also the value for `matched_entry`), `entry_chars`,
  `multi_section`, `replace_unsafe` for an entry too long to show in full.
- **The loss guard counts characters too**, not just entries, and notices an
  entry that kept its beginning and lost its body. It now also works on files
  with only a few entries.

### Fixed — what counts as a human saying something

- Role and visibility are filtered **in SQL** (`role='user' OR observed=1`,
  `active=1 OR compacted=1`). On a busy install that is tens of thousands of
  rows and ~0.5 GB of RSS saved; on a small one the pass still got 3× faster.
- Compression copies the row it folds and both copies are visible: rows are
  deduplicated by `(session_id, content, timestamp)`. One compaction used to add
  +0.04 to a fact's score.
- `untrusted_sources` defaults to `cron`, `subagent` and `tool` — the core
  groups them the same way, and a subagent brief reads exactly like a person
  talking. New `exclude_patterns` drops machine text that has no source of its
  own (bridge briefs, forwarded digests) by regex.
- Harness inserts are recognised by their exact strings from Hermes 0.21.5 (the
  preserved todo snapshot, both turn-failure notices, `Operation interrupted`)
  and matched anywhere in the text, because the core glues the todo snapshot
  into a real reply.
- A reply quote counts only when the person added words of their own, and a
  quoted machine report never counts: a bare "ок" under a quoted cron report
  used to corroborate everything the report mentioned, including the entries it
  proposed to delete.

### Fixed — Russian

- Corroboration compares **stems**: «Мы окончательно переехали, в Лиссабоне…»
  now corroborates «переехал в Лиссабон», while «Мой брат переехал в Москву»
  does not. Both were wrong before, in opposite directions.
- `_stem()` strips frequent endings instead of cutting to 5 characters, so
  «контент» and «контейнер» are no longer one stem.
- Text is NFC-normalized with ё→е before tokenizing.
- A single shared word is "distinctive" at ≥8 characters for Latin but ≥10 for
  anything else — in Russian 8 is not rare, and one shared «обязательно» was
  enough for a false mention. Frequent Russian words of 5+ letters joined the
  stopword list.
- Negations and comparatives (`не`, `нет`, `без`, `более`…) stay significant for
  the store-duplicate check: «ест острое» and «не ест острое» are opposite facts
  that used to collapse into one.

### Fixed — numbers and dates

- `25 000`, `25\u00a0000`, `25,000` and `25000` are one number: every retelling
  of a price used to look like a conflict.
- A month said in words is compared like a number, so moving «15 марта» to
  «15 апреля» becomes a possible update instead of being swallowed by the fuzzy
  dedupe as "already in memory".

### Fixed — screening

- More key shapes: `gsk_` (Groq), `ntn_`/`secret_` (Notion), `sk_`+hex,
  `gho_`/`ghs_`/`ghu_` (GitHub).
- A credential marker no longer has to touch the colon: "Пароль от wifi в
  квартире: X" and "Password for the router is: X" are caught, while "сменила
  пароль от Wi-Fi" stays an event, not a secret.
- Injection patterns match word stems and include the four the core's own cron
  scanner uses, so quarantine happens before Hermes blocks the whole prompt.
- The extraction job screens the messages it hands over (that was the one door
  into the prompt nobody watched), and a "still relevant?" preview of an entry
  that itself holds a credential is redacted.

### Fixed — operations

- **Writes waiting for approval are read.** With `memory.write_approval: true` a
  cron write answers `staged: true` and the file does not change: the queue
  (`pending/memory`) is now treated as a second memory file, so a queued
  candidate is not offered again, an entry whose removal is queued is not asked
  about, and a queue of ≥5 items older than 7 days raises one alert.
- Promotions get a short rest (`gates.promotion_cooldown_days`, 3 days). They
  used to repeat every night "until written", which under an approval gate meant
  forever.
- Char limits and the timezone come from Hermes' `config.yaml` when the skill
  does not set them. The example's numbers are the core defaults, and an install
  with raised limits was told "memory at 285%" every night.
- Acknowledgement counts only a real answer: no `tool_calls`, not
  `display_kind=failed_turn`, not a harness notice. "Operation interrupted."
  used to pass for one.
- The extraction job checks `memory.provider`, not just `fact_source`: without
  the provider there is no `fact_store` tool, and up to 200 messages were handed
  to a model that could not store them while the cursor moved past them.
- Expired dated events are listed in their own read-only section instead of
  vanishing, and the hint list covers meetings, calls, flights and appointments
  — not only school words.
- The wake gate survives a malformed `dreaming.json` (it used to exit 1 with a
  traceback, so Hermes woke the agent with "Script Error"), and `dream_error`
  now carries the tail of the pass's stderr instead of a bare exception repr.
- `install.py --check` warns that the holographic provider writes through
  `fact_store` — a channel the approval gate does not cover.
- The diary path moved into the config (`diary.path`), state files keep their
  owner when written from `docker exec` as root, and a non-local `--deliver`
  attaches the job to a session.

### Added

- **`trust_feedback`.** A fact a human rejected with `dream-reject.py` keeps its
  trust in the store, so the holographic provider's prefetch goes on injecting
  it into ordinary turns — the rejection taught the dream, not retrieval. The
  pass now lists such facts (trust at or above `gates.feedback_trust_floor`,
  0.3) with a ready `fact_feedback(action="unhelpful", fact_id=…)` call for the
  agent. The script still never writes the store; the section is deliberately
  **not** in `precheck.actionable_keys` (worth doing while the agent is awake,
  not worth a wake), capped by `gates.feedback_cap` and rested by its own
  cooldown. Only for `fact_source: holographic` — no other source has the tool.
- `matched_entry` and the atomic `operations[]` batch are now part of the
  instructions: two or more changes go in one all-or-nothing call whose char
  limit is checked against the final state, so freeing space and adding an entry
  fit together.
- `stats.pending_writes`, `staged_suppressed`, `promotions_suppressed`.

### Documented

- The holographic provider **leaves the Hermes core on 2026-10-15** (its
  standalone copy is currently unmaintained). `fact_source: holographic` is
  still the default and still works — it just has to be installed as a plugin
  after that date. Both READMEs and `install.py --check` say so, and
  `fact_source: none` remains the zero-dependency option.

### Not confirmed

The review also reported that a CRLF memory file parses as a single entry. It
does not: the core reads memory through `read_text`, i.e. with universal
newlines (verified against 0.21.5). A test now pins that.

**Tests:** 309 (was 255).

## 2.1.1 — 2026-10-03

Catalog-review follow-up: stale job bindings, the gate's own home detection,
tests against the real registry.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-10-03

No core patching any more: the cron jobs run the plugin's own skill.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-10-02

Agent Plugins v1 package (`plugin.json` + `skills/dreaming/`), a configurable
fact source (`holographic` / `sqlite` / `jsonl` / `none`), `dream.py --dry-run`,
`scripts/install.py`. Answered "still relevant?" questions stay answered, and
the extraction cursor waits for the agent's acknowledgement.

## 1.x — 2026-08-16 … 2026-09-17

First public release: the deterministic nightly pass, the wake gate, the reject
list, cooldowns, the loss guard, `excluded_threads` and `untrusted_sources`,
waking on a full memory file, and the first external-review round (evidence
hygiene, the `(ts, id)` extraction cursor, cooldown acknowledgement,
fail-closed trust).
